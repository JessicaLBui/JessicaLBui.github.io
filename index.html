          The Summit is the geographical center of the           <a href="http://www.gobreck.com/" title="Website to Breckenridge">Breckenridge</a> Ski Area. It also
          has the widest variety of terrain, from beginner trails to steep bowl
          terrain. Lower Peak 8 consists of beginner trails, as well as many
          intermediate trails mixed with some advanced runs. There are four
          lifts out of the base area: Lift 7, which services a beginner learning
          area; Lift 5, which services more advanced beginner terrain, the
          Freeway and Park Lane Terrain Parks, and the Alpine Slide. At the
          north end of the base area, the Colorado SuperChair provides access to
          the Vista Haus, central Peak 8, as well as access to the Peak 8 back
          bowls and Peak 9, while the Rocky Mountain SuperChair provides access
          to northern Peak 8, the T-Bar, Peak 7, and Peak 6. <strong>HI DAD!</strong>

          In 2007, The Summit hosted the first Winter RadAir It was one of the
          first action sports tours for winter sports. The Summit continues to
          host the event annually in the 2nd or 3rd weekend in December each
          year. Many of the top athletes in action sports from around the world
          continue to participate in the RadAir Tour. The Summit Pro Team
          usually constitutes many of the athletes each year, and are jointed by
          other participants such as Shaun Black, Hannah Stabile, Tanner Foyer,
          Andreas Baald, Gretchen LeBlay, Simon Duvallee, Sarah Blue, Tom
          Florisch, and Travis
